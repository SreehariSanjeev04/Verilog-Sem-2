# Smart Parking System (Gate Level)
This is a verilog project created as final assignment for Sem 2 Logic Design course at NIT Calicut. I have implemented the system using Gate Level coding. 

The system consist of 8 features for 8 parking spots, including authentication, alerts as well as refuelling facilites (electric, petrol and cng) and payment simulation for the parking duration with refuelling charges.
